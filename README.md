### Selected Topic
An anlysis of the Housing Market sales data from 2011-2023.

### Reasons for Topic Selection
As individuals who are or will eventually be looking to own property in Maryland, we found an intial pull to this topic. As we began to explore and analyze this data, we began to see a path to be able to answer different economical questions about where someone may want to purchase property within the state.

### Analysis Questions

#### Tableau
Over the last 5 years, which Maryland counties have:
1. The lowest average price?
2. Shown the lowest levels of percent increase?
3. Experienced a low or high median number of days on the market? (Low days could indicate higher prices and high days could indicate lower prices)
4. Sold homes at the highest or lowest prices?
5. Sold the highest and lowest number of homes?

#### Supervised Learning
Using a decades worth of Maryland home sales data, can we:
1. Use a Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest model to accurately classify whether prices for 2024 will increase of decrease?
2. Use a Linear Regression and line of best fit to predict the median price of homes?
3. Improve upon the linear regression using encoding and scaling?
